                <p>By analyzing the behaviour of your child through our mood-analysis algorithms we can warn you for signs
                    of depression and the feelings of your child. Our algorithms are backed up by science.</p>

                <h2>Filtering</h2>
                <p>We give you full control over what your child is allowed to search for online, and what not. Our
                   extensive filtering possibilities put the control in your hands. You can for example get notified
                   on your child's use of a `adult` keyword, or even shut down directly the computer. KidCare provides
                   predefined lists with keywords, but you can also create your own.</p>

                <h2>Realtime</h2>
                <p>Watch in realtime what your child is typing. While our monitoring-device is unnoticeable registering
                key strokes that your child is typing, you can watch it live from your own pc. Either this is from within your
                own house or at your work. The control is in your hand, hence if needed you can just shut
                down the pc.</p>

                <h2>Creditcard safe</h2>

                <p>Afraid that your child will buy goods online without permission? With our software this will never happen
                    anymore. You can easily register your credit card number in our application. Once your credit card number
                    is typed, our software will block the payment.</p>
